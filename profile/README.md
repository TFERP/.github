# Tropical Forest Ecology Research Programme

The Tropical Forest Ecology Research (TFER) programme is coordinated by the Forest Ecology team at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, National Parks Board (Singapore).

## Access management

Current Forest Ecology staff (and interns) will be added to respective teams which will give Read access to all repositories, as well as Admin/Maintain/Write access to selected repositories for that team. When they leave service, a discussion will be held on which repositories they will retain access to, if any. They will then be converted to outside collaborators and given access accordingly to these repositories; they will otherwise be removed from the organisation by default.

## Tips

* Create a folder on your computer (e.g., called "TFER") and clone all repositories from this organisation as sister folders inside. This will help to ensure cross-repo use of script, data, etc. It will also help to resolve the problem of same names for any repositories forked between organisations or with your personal GitHub account.
