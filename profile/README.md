# Tropical Forest Ecology Research Programme

The Tropical Forest Ecology Research (TFER) programme is coordinated by the Forest Ecology team at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, National Parks Board (Singapore).

## Access management

Current Forest Ecology staff will be added to respective teams which will give Read access to all repositories, as well as Write access to selected repositories for that team. When staff leave service, a discussion will be held on which repositories they will retain access to, if any. Access to these repositories will be added as external guests; they will otherwise be removed from the organisation by default.

Likewise, interns will be given external guest access roles to specific repositories based on need.

## Tips

* Create a folder on your computer (e.g., called "TFER") and create all repositories from this organisation as sister folders inside. This will help to ensure cross-repo use of script, data, etc.
